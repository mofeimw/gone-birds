                <p>The Carolina parakeet (Conuropsis carolinensis) was the only parrot species native to the eastern United States. Sadly, it became extinct in the early 20th century due to a combination of factors, including habitat loss, widespread hunting, and the introduction of diseases, like psittacosis.</p>

                <p>The Ivory-billed woodpecker (Campephilus principalis) was a large woodpecker species native to the southeastern United States and Cuba. Declared critically endangered and likely extinct, the last confirmed sighting was in the 1940s, primarily due to habitat loss and logging.</p>

                <p>Bachman's warbler (Vermivora bachmanii) was a small songbird native to the southeastern United States. Declared extinct, the last confirmed sighting was in the mid-20th century, and its disappearance is attributed to habitat destruction in its breeding and wintering grounds.</p>

                <p>The Passenger pigeon (Ectopistes migratorius) was once one of the most abundant bird species in North America, forming massive flocks. Unfortunately, extensive hunting and habitat destruction led to its rapid decline, and the last known individual died in captivity in 1914, marking its extinction.</p>

                <p>The Heath hen (Tympanuchus cupido cupido) was a subspecies of the greater prairie chicken native to the eastern United States. It became extinct in 1932, primarily due to habitat loss, hunting, and diseases introduced by domestic poultry.</p>

                <p>The Great Auk (Pinguinus impennis) was a large, flightless seabird that inhabited the North Atlantic. Hunted extensively for its down, meat, and feathers, the last known individuals were killed in 1844 on the Icelandic island of Eldey, leading to the species' extinction.</p>

                <p>The Labrador duck (Camptorhynchus labradorius) was a sea duck that once inhabited the eastern coast of North America. Declared extinct in the late 19th century, the reasons for its decline are unclear, but factors such as overhunting, habitat destruction, and changes in food availability likely played a role.</p>

                <p>The Dodo (Raphus cucullatus) was a flightless bird endemic to the island of Mauritius. Discovered by European sailors in the late 16th century, the Dodo became extinct by the mid-17th century due to human activities, including hunting, habitat destruction, and the introduction of invasive species.</p>

                <p>The Mauritius Blue Pigeon (Alectroenas nitidissima) was a pigeon species native to Mauritius. It became extinct in the 1830s, likely due to habitat loss and hunting, compounded by the introduction of invasive species.</p>

                <p>The Dusky Seaside Sparrow (Ammospiza nigrescens) was a small bird species endemic to Florida's Atlantic coast. Declared extinct in the 1990s, its disappearance was primarily attributed to habitat loss caused by land development and the alteration of water flow in its marshy habitats.</p>

                <p>The Spectacled Cormorant (Phalacrocorax perspicillatus) was a large, flightless cormorant species native to the Kuril Islands and the Sea of Okhotsk. Extinct since the mid-19th century, reasons for its decline include overhunting by humans and introduced predators, contributing to its eventual extinction.</p>
